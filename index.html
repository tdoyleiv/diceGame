						<h1 class="text-center display-3">Vicksburg, 1863</h1>
                        <p class="lead">The <strong>American Civil War</strong> is in the summer of its second year. Despite early setbacks, the <strong>Confederacy</strong> has checked every advance of the <strong>Union</strong> into its sovereign territory. The <strong>Army of Northern Virginia</strong>, led by the brilliant <strong>Robert E. Lee</strong> has dealt the <strong>Army of the Potomac</strong> one grievous blow after another. 
						The latest has come against odds of just over two to one numerical superiority in the wilderness near <strong>Chancellorsville</strong>. Emboldened, Lee marches north, looking to take the war into <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> and the metropoles of the East.
						Meanwhile, in the West, desperate for victory, the <strong>Union</strong> sends its <strong>Army of the Tennessee</strong>, under the <i>dux non grata</i> <strong>Ulysses S. Grant</strong>, to complete the reconquest of <strong>The Father of Waters</strong> and sever the <strong>Trans-Mississippi</strong> from the Confederacy...</p>
                        <hr class="my-4">
                        <p>The keystone of a vital link to desperately needed cereals, cattle, horses, & men, <strong>Jefferson Davis</strong> has ordered Pennsylvania-born 
						<strong>John C. Pemberton</strong> to hold <strong>Vicksburg</strong> - at all costs. An artillery specialist, Pemberton has turned the hilled city into the most formidable fortified position since the <strong>Lines of Torres Vedras</strong>.
						After crossing the <strong>Mississippi</strong> southwest of the citadel, Grant has outmanoeuvred a sally from the 33,000 rebel defenders and puts his army of 75,000 to the task of investing the city. However, Davis has also sent <strong>Joseph E. Johnston</strong> with a force 30,000 men to relieve the beleaguered defenders. <strong>President Abraham Lincoln</strong> nervously awaits news from Grant's headquarters in the field. Can you reduce the fortifications and turn the tide of war before Johnston arrives? 
						Step into the boots of General Grant and take the <strong>Gibraltar of the West!</strong><p>
